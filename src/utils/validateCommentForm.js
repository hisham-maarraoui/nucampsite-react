// I worked on this code as part of a coding bootcamp curriculum. I followed along with the instructions 
// (i.e. followed/copied instructions from the course/instructors and didn't design everything from scratch myself) while
//  writing code in this project/file. Moreover, I  acknowledge receiving support from and/or working/collaborating
//   with instructors/classmates, generally as is expected from being a participant in the coding bootcamp.
